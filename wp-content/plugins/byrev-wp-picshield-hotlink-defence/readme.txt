== Description ==

ByREV WP-PICShield - "Images HOTLINK Defence" is probably the world’s best wordpress plugins to protect against hotlinking images by search engines and other sites that basically steal your bandwidth, decrease the traffic on your site, and you can lose a large amount of revenue.

Before Install: Some incompatibility with Varnish, Lighthttpd, and other "cache" services - Images must not be cached !!! CDN users must ensure that the images served by the CDNS server may be manual updated or have expiration period.

ByREV WP-PICShield Features:

**Very important: Read before use and install!**
Varnish, Lighthttpd, and other “cache” services is not 100% compatible with this plugin … probably only if cache is disabled for all images.

CDN images will not be redirected and no watermarked (if they are served correctly) … so, clearly, this plugin is suitable only for standard installation and for CDN with custom htaccess configurable by webmasters. CDN users must ensure that the images served by the CDN’s server may be manual updated or have expiration period.

Beware of those who use the Jetpack. CDN wordpress (Photon) never expire, and the lowest WP-PICShield version that allows Photon to take pictures correctly is 1.8.9.d ! If you are unsure, do not use this plugin. Photon Cache can not be updated, watermark images remain forever (unless you change the images path or filename)
